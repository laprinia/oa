 * In the game, our main character repairs a robot that you can control for a limited time.

 * Inspired by the mechanic from Skyward Sword, within a radius, the robot views the world from the past and can collect resources.
 
 * The whole mechanic is done through a shader, that takes two separate textures for the environment (one being the beat-down version of the other), the radius of the spawned robot and the color of the circle.
 
 * All environment GameObjects, such as the ground or rocks, use this shader. Some of them have scripts that make GameObjects appear using animations.

* The main objective of the game is to collect all resources, which stack up in the main player's inventory.
* Having all the resources, the player can activate the building platform, which animates, adding Materials one by one.
* When all materials are activated, the Timeshift logic is reversed.
